# Project 2 (refactoring for fileIO, documentation, and testing)



## 1. Discuss with classmates on the discussion boards and show that you can create a document with the following:

### 1. how do you think you would add file reading and writing functionality to your menu program,
Like cmd, create a list of directory and search in it.
### 2. how do you think the try and except clauses of Python work and what exactly the FileNotFoundError class is,
When there is a exception happens to the program, the program will corresponds to a specific type to handle the exception.
### 3. identify sections of your code that you could create methods out of,
### 4. design tests that would show your program working correctly (positive tests and negative tests),



## 2. Create a couple test functions that test some functionality for your program (what attributes of your object can be tested for, what functions can be tested, and what guarantees do you have about how this object will behave?)
## (this may require a bit more research than we cover in class so far, but this part of the assignment is graded based on the attempt, not based on writing a professional set of tests)



## 3. Get another person’s menu program (perhaps here) and remember to keep notes on the following:
## (Note: Also, if you are willing to volunteer your code, feel free to submit it to the public folder!)

### 1. Try to add file reading and writing to their program, note whether you accomplish this or not, how difficult was this,

### 2. identify sections of their code that you think could or should be made into methods or functions,

### 3. what tests would show their programming working correctly (or would even break their code!),

### 4. When you run pydocstyle and pycodestyle on their code (if you have it installed), what warnings and errors do you get?

###     What do these messages mean?
###     In your opinion are the programmer’s style differences from the PEP standards acceptable?
